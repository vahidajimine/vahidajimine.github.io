I am working with a small team of local entrepreneurs, developers, designers, and business leaders to grow the tech and startup community on the Big Island of Hawaii. My passion is developing a startup which builds table-top RPG game tools. One such product is a Dungeons & Dragons Dungeon Master tool for web & mobile built with Swift, Xcode and Javascript.
